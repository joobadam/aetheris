        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is a complaint and what are the reasons for filing a Complaint?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A complaint is a legally regulated procedure for resolving customer complaints due to defects in the delivered product. If there is a manufacturing defect in the product you have ordered and picked up (e.g., defective perfume spraying equipment) or a hidden defect (e.g., altered chemical properties of the product) and when this defect makes it difficult or impossible for you to use the product in the usual way, you have the right to file a complaint to Belodore, in order to eliminate this shortcoming. If the inappropriateness occurs within six months from the date of acceptance, in case of a customer considered as consumer, the inappropriateness shall be presumed to have existed at the time the risk was transferred, unless this is contrary to the type of conduit and nature of the inappropriateness or the seller proves otherwise. The reason for the complaint may be the discrepancy between the delivered and ordered product.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is not considered a reason for filing a Complaint?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The defect in the product occurred after the delivery, as a consequence of your action or accident, or the risk of accidental failure or damage to the product after the product is handed over to the consumer or a third party determined by the consumer, is the responsibility of the customer, and this is not a reason to complain.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If the defect is insignificant, i.e., if there is a defect in the delivered product, but it does not affect the usability of the product in the usual way, your complaint will not be accepted. Regarding the durability, fragrant notes, and intensity of perfume products, and having in mind the features of online shopping, we recommend that you, before buying any of the perfume products, try the product in one of our stores. The safest way to make the right choice of perfume product is to apply the product tester to the skin and find out how it reacts in contact with the features of your skin in a certain period of time. The persistence, fragrant note, and intensity of the scent largely depend on the interaction of the perfume formula with the features of your skin and is individual. If the tester of the product available in our stores and the product itself do not differ on a neutral basis ("bloter"), your complaint will be rejected as unfounded. If the product is good: The Customer can file a complaint against a product that works in accordance with its regular purpose and is in accordance with everything agreed, but such a complaint will be rejected.
